# Tic-Tac-Toe game (also called Noughts and Crosses)

Tic Tac Toe, command line game written in GO on Linux, the code will compile 
on widows but it doses not display correctly, project was a learning experience,
also added to Git as a learning experience.

Code is	messy sorry but	it was never meant to be publicly available.....
